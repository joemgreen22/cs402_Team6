# Cook Book App Manual

## Overview

This application is used so you can store and add recipes for your very own recipe book! 
All that the app requires is that over time you add your own family, friend's, or even
acquaintances' recipes so you can start your very own catalogue. Whether you a new
user or a user looking to help, this guide will hopefully set you on the right track.

## Getting Started

First, when you boot up the app you should be met with a loading screen. Wait till all the 
recipes are loaded and then you'll be directed to a main screen with all the recipes listed.
Then we can continue onto the basic features of the app.

## Basic Features

###  The Main Screen
When booting up the main menu. A list of recipes on cards will appear with a short description
and pictures accompanying them. If you touch/click on the recipe cards then it will flip to show
its ingredients and instructions. You can then swipe on either the ingredients or instructions 
to get view all of them. There is also a button on the front of the card to have the recipe expand
to full screen mode in the app. Clicking the back button on the full screen recipe will go back 
to the list.

The list is able to scroll up and down visiting all the different recipes you have added.

### Adding and Editing Recipes
The plus button on the top left of the screen is the add button. This button will take you to 
a new screen in which you can enter information for a new recipe you want to add to the list. 
You will need to add a title, description, ingredients, and instructions to make the dish. While 
not mandatory, it is recommend to add your own picture of the dish for quick recognition!

When adding ingredients and instructions for the dish, each item is added one-by-one until you 
are done adding for each section respectively. You will be able to see a quick list when each 
item is entered.

For editing, click the button on the upper right hand side of the main screen with the recipe list.
This will take you to a new screen in which the title, description, ingredients, and instructions 
can be edited. For the ingredients and instructions, you can edit their lists respectively and add
more ingredients or steps or remove them as necessary. A back and save button are available to exit
the editing menu or save progress.

## Final Notes
Your recipes will be saved to your device and will not persist beyond such. If you lose your 
device, delete the app, or restore your device to factory setting then all progress will be 
lost. This is a crucial consideration if you no longer want the app installed or lose the 
device the app is on.

## Conclusion
We hope you enjoy this application and trust our app to store all your recipes for your future 
culinary adventures!
