# Cook Book App Manual

## Overview

This application is used so you can store and add recipes for your very own recipe book! 
All that the app requires is that over time you add your own family, friend's, or even
acquaintances' recipes so you can start your very own catalogue. Whether you a new
user or a user looking to help, this guide will hopefully set you on the right track.

## Getting Started

Firstly, when you boot up the app you should be met with a loading screen. This is normal and the loading sign is actually a button. Press this button and you'll be directed to a main screen with all the recipes listed. Then we can continue onto the basic features of the app.


## Basic Features

###  The Main Screen
When booting up the main menu. A list of recipes on cards will appear with a short description and pictures accompanying them. If a card is click then it will flip to show their ingredient and instruction set. If a ingredient card is swiped, then a full screen version of said recipe will appear. Clicking the back button on the full screen recipe will go back to the list.

The list is able to scroll up and down relieving different recipes.

### Adding and Editing Recipes
The plus button on the top left of the screen is the add button. This button will take you to a new screen in which you can enter information on a new recipe you want to add to the list. You will need to add a title, description, ingredients, and instructions to make the dish. While not mandatory, it is recommend to add your own picture of the dish for quick recognition!

When adding ingredients and instructions for the dish, each item is added one-by-one until you are done adding for each section respectively. You will be able to see a quick list when each item is entered.

For editing, click the button on the upper right hand side of the top of the main screen with the recipe list. This will take you to a new screen in which the title, description, ingredients, and instructions can be edited. For the ingredients and instructions, you can edit their lists respectively and add more ingredients or steps or remove them as necessary. A back and save button are available to exit the editing menu or save progress.

## Final Notes
Your recipes will be saved to your device and will not persist beyond such. If you lose your device, delete the app, or restore your device to factory setting then all progress will be lost. This is a crucial consideration if you no longer want the app installed or lose the device the app is on.

## Conclusion
We hope you enjoy this application and trust our app to store all your recipes for your future culinary adventures!
